Group anomaly detection using Hierarichal Bayesian Network.
In this project, we tried to identify group of unsual data points in a dataset. We apply, hierarichal model proposed (Xiong,Poczos and Schneider 2011) to infer the likelihood of a group of points in large dataset as anomalous. 

One type of *group anomalies* is just a group of individually anomalous points. A more interesting, and often more difficult case is when the individual data points are normal, but their distribution as a group is unusual. In this project we tried to identify anomalous user behavior on a collective users activity per unit time group by individual user.
